					<p class="">Search Engine Optimization is an integral part of modern web development. It assists search engines in indexing a web site correctly. As an example, you wouldn't want a site that sells fishing poles to be indexed when someone searches for bowling shoes - but you would want that site indexed when someone searches for "fishing poles online". By using a number of strategies, we optimize our clients sites for the major search engines.</p>

					<p>By carefully grooming your content, using semantic markup, and doing the proper keyword research, we can optimize your site to respond favorably in search results. A properly optimized site generates more traffic, and helps people who want to find you do just that.</p>
